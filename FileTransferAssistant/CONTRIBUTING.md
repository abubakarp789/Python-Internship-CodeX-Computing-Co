## Coding Standards

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Write docstrings for all public modules, functions, and classes
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task
- Write meaningful commit messages

### Pre-commit Hooks

We use pre-commit hooks to maintain code quality. Install them with:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

The hooks will run automatically on each commit.

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries

Example:
```
feat: add dark mode support
fix: resolve issue with file transfer cancellation
